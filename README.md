Flatiron Rails Project Assessment - Somi's Merch Manager

????????

## To Run for development or personal use
Clone the repo to your machine and run below command in your terminal to install all gems and their dependencies
```
$ bundle install
```

Next run the migration and seed files. If installing for personal use, run the second command as you will not need seeded data. Passwords for the accounts are in the seed file. Note: Rake Setup command will reset any data currently in the database if you have the database setup.

Development:

```
$ rails db:setup
```

Personal:
```
$ rails db:migration
```

Now start your local server to access the site in your web browser
```
$ rails s
```

Open your preferred web browser and in the address bar, navigate to the address as listed replacing the hashes for the port numbers given in your terminal
```
http://localhost:####
```

HAVE FUN!
